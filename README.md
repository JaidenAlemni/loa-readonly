This is a repository of the game scripts used in [Legends of Astravia](https://www.astraviagame.com), and has been temporarily made available for reference purposes only. These scripts not intended for free use (for now). Some scripts and blocks of code have been intentionally redacted.

Some of the Game_, Scene_, Window_, Sprite_ etc. scripts are the base scripts for RPG Maker XP and were created by Enterbrain, with some re-written and expanded upon. They've been kept here to make some of the extensions more obvious.
